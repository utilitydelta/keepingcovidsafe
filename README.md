QR code guest registration app for covid19

## details

This is a simple ASP.Net Core app that uses razor pages. Users can sign up and add venues. Each venue has a unique QR code that can be printed out and placed at the venue for customers to scan with their phones. They can then enter their details for covid-19 contract tracing purposes.

You can optionally enable email confirmation, it is currently setup to use Sendgrid. Remember to update the terms and conditions and privacy policy, keepingcovidsafe.com branding, etc. for your own deployment.

Hope if can be of use to someone!
